The right queue for your use case depends on a few factors:
* Producer/Consumer thread counts: If you know upfront you will only have a single Consumer thread or a single Producer thread JCTools offers you specialized queues to capitalize on this property. The queue all have a prefix which tells you which usecase they fit: SPSC(Single Producer Single Consumer), MPSC(Multi Producer Single Consumer), SPMC(Single Producer Multi Consumer), MPMC(Multi Producer Multi Consumer). You can expect the single threaded side of the queue to offer reduced costs(better performance).
* Bounded/Unbounded: Do you want an unbounded queue? this is generally not such a great idea, but is sometimes required. The Spsc/Mpsc/Spmc/MpscArrayQueue implementations are bounded as are the Chunked/GrowableArrayQueue variants for Spsc/Mpsc. The Spsc/MpscLinkedQueue implementations are unbounded as are the Spsc/MpscUnboundedArrayQueue.
* Memory pressure: what footprint should an empty queue have? For some cases where many queues need to be maintained per application (e.g. actor systems) we want to minimize the footprint per queue. The Spsc/MpscLinkedQueue offer a minimal footprint for unbounded queues. The Chunked/GrowableArrayQueue variants for Spsc/Mpsc offer a lower footprint bounded variant(an empty queue maintains a single chunk, which can be a small array). Finally the Spsc/MpscUnboundedArrayQueue offer a compromise between upfront allocation and overhead per element and throughput.
